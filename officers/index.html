      <p>Hi all! I'm Aaron, a computer hardware enthusiast, DIY hobbyist, and eSports fan. I started playing osu! since 2013 and though I have never been musically (rhymically?) inclined, I rather enjoy the game a lot. </p>

      <p>Speaking of hardware and DIY, I made a two-key keypad for osu! called "two-K." It was a project that started in April 2015 and involved 3D modelling using SolidWorks, 3D printing, and soldering.</p>
      
      <p>In the rare occasions when I'm not browsing reddit or watching YouTube, I like to play racquetball or build computers for people. Hit me up if you're interested in either of those things :D</p>

      <p>Hey all! I entered UCI in the fall of 2014 as first year computer science major. In my free time I like to watch lots of <a href="http://myanimelist.net/animelist/LazerGuard">anime</a>, play a whole bunch of different games(<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041258262">Steam games</a>, <a href="http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=lazer+guard">League of Legends</a> and <a title="LazerGuard #1734">Overwatch )</a>, and I also like to yoyo. I started playing osu! in 2013 starting out as a mouse only player and gradually switching over to tablet + keyboard. I no longer play osu! actively and reached a peak rank of 9.8k.</p>

      <p>Hello, my name is Kenneth Yam. I’m a Computer Game Science major that blundered his way to UCI. I’m a hybrid mouse-and-keyboard player that started with mouse acceleration for 2-and-a-half years. Now that I’m smarter and turned it off, I reached 1.5k as my peak rank in Sep. 2015, but decayed due to school. I play tennis, video games, and violin (woohoo stereotypes). I’m returning to other games like Hearthstone and MapleStory. I don’t watch anime, so don’t ask me for any recommendations. You can show me cool stuff instead.</p>

      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Paxton Ngai-Neng Wong, and I’m a Computer Science major at UCI. I’m a tablet and keyboard player (wow such unique) at rank 11.5k as of when this was written- I sucked at DT because I tap like a noob, so I turned into an HR player. My hobbies are being a weab, playing the violin and drawing. I used to do Cross Country and Long Distance Track in high school, so occasionally I enjoy running. 
I found out about this club from a friend in high school who found out about it on Reddit. I never would have expected to be an officer, but after all the cool experiences I had with the club I decided to become one.

      <p>Hey everyone, my name is Matt and I am a third year software engineer. You can also call me Kenneth, Ken, Kenny, Keneth with one “n,” or whatever you feel is appropriate. I don’t really play osu!, so you are probably asking yourself, “Why is he an officer?” Same. A friend of mine found out from a reddit post that there is an osu! club here at UCI, and told me to check it out. Normally I would’ve been gone by the next meeting, but the personalities introduced to me were quite “intriguing.” Next thing I knew, I was at every meeting since fall of 2015. Someone save me.
Also, I play a lot of Heroes of the Storm, Smash 4, Fire Emblem, Steam, and more. Feel free to hit me up if you play any of these!</p>

      <p>Hey everybody! I entered UCI as a first year but I didn't join osu! UCI until my second year. Even though I didn't join until my second year I actually met the president in my first year randomly when I found him soldering keycaps with another officer Aaron. I told him I liked Shibayan Records and he said "Coool." I enjoy playing rhythm games like osu!, Stepmania, DDR, Project Diva!, and SDVX. I didn't officially join until on a whim I checked out the club and played osu!mania. I said osu!standard looked to hard so I didn't want to play it. A few weeks later I bought a tablet.</p>

      <p>What's up everyone. I'm Wax Chug da Gwad. Some of you guys may know me as Max Chung. I started playing osu! 3 years ago, but have only been playing it on-and-off as a side game, with months of break in between. It wasn't until last fall quarter that Justin, Brad, and I randomly met up and found out we all played osu!.</p>

      <p>Thinking it was a good chance for me to get more serious about the game, meet new people, and try something new, I took the lead in starting up this club and bringing it to where it is now. It's been an absolute blast playing the game with everyone so far, and I hope we grow in numbers and do greater things in the future!</p>

      <p>Outside of osu!, I'm an active officer and developer of the <a href="http://vgdc-uci.com/">Video Game Development Club at UCI</a>. I love making games, and it's thanks to VGDC that I've met a ton of awesome people and have the passion I have now. Big shoutouts to them! If you're at all interested in game development, definitely check them out and get involved.</p>

      <p>I watch a fair bit of anime in my free time, not religiously anymore, but still a good chunk here and there, and as a result of anime, osu!, and NicoNico, I listen to a lot of Japanese/anime/vocaloid/utaite music. My favorite animes of all time are <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei">The Tatami Galaxy</a>, the first 15 minutes of <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline">Redline</a>, and the last 15 minutes of <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game">Mind Game</a>. My favorite vocaloid producer is <a href="http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Mikito-P">MikitoP</a>, and my favorite song by him is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaQl3f4fFWI">Sayoko</a>" by <a href="http://utaite.wikia.com/wiki/Kano">Kano</a>.</p>

      <p>Hello there! My name is Victor Stolle, and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student. I started playing osu! 3 years ago when Max introduced this difficult rhythm game in between queues of League of Legends.</p>

      <p>In osu! my average song difficulty is between 3-4 stars, and I play with the traditional mouse + keyboard setup. My favorite genres of music in the game are fast-paced, high BPM songs belonging to either electronic or rock.</p>

      <p>Other than osu! I am a somewhat-active member of the Video Game Design Club, a member of the intramural water polo team, and a video game enthusiast. I play a lot of League of Legends and Diablo 3, and my favourite strategy game is Age of Empires 3. I also watch "a little bit" of anime every now and then, and listen to all genres of music.</p>

      <p>I'm Jimmy and I'm a 4th year Psychology student. I'm the only non-STEM major in the club which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it. Last year I handled mostly social media, promotion, and tournament organization in the club. This year I still have the same responsibilities but I'm also filling in as the President following Max's graduation. I'm big on cooking, mechanical keyboards, swimming and sleep. I used to be a much more active osu! player, capping out at the high 8k's, but due to school keeping me out of practice I've been unable to maintain my rank or speed. Unfortunately I can't play DT anymore but I've recently found much more enjoyment in slowing it down with some No Mod. Nowadays I use osu! primarily as a means to get new music and "enjoying game". I'm still notoriously bad at streaming and I'm probably the least consistent player I know. I'm still more of a jump map player but I'm slowly warming up to more technical maps as my reading improves. My favorite maps nowadays include World's End, Girl's Rondo (P A N's difficulty), Sakura No Uta (Alyce's difficulty) and Akatsuki Zukuyo. I'm a pretty active League of Legends player as well, you can find me under the ign Jims, hit me up sometime and let's play!</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm Royce Sato, a third year chemical engineering student. I started playing osu! around Fall 2013, and I haven't improved since then. I play mouse+keyboard; I used to play tablet, but my hand couldn't take the heat, so I stick with mouse. I don't DT farm. I also play mania 4k, it's really fun and everyone should quit standard and play mania. Other hobbies include playing the piano, yo-yoing, which Jimmy and Justin got me into, and speedcubing. I'm also eternally “studying” Japanese.</p>

      <p>こんにちは fellow osu! players! My name is Bradley (Brad) 
	I graduated from Leigh High School in San Jose and came to UCI to study Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I used to have a lot of interest in games, 
	but after discovering the glorious nippon I didn't have time for them anymore.
	I knew about osu! since May 2014 and I thought the concept of the game was pretty cool; though I didn't really take the game seriously until the start of Fall 2014.</p>
      <p>My friend/roomate/other club officer (Justin) was actually pretty good at the game, and watching him play motivated me to try and git gud. 
	Besides osu!, other things I do for fun involve technology and Japanese media.</p>
