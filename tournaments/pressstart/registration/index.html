      <h2 id="pressstart">Press Start: Irvine 2015</h2>
      <p>osu! UCI be hosting an osu! tournament at <a href="http://startlan.com/">Press Start: Irvine 2015</a>, a LAN that will be coming to Irvine next month. The LAN takes place May 9-10th in the Bren Event Center. There'll be a lot of games and tournaments with a lot of great prizes, so make sure to check out the entire event! The osu! tournament will play only on the 10th, so you can join other tournaments the day before. To register specifically for the osu! tournament, follow these two steps:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.lanreg.org/pressstart/irvine2015">Reserve a seat</a> for the LAN. Enter the promocode "MSIDRAGON" for a $10 discount. The tournaments are free to watch, but entering as a competitor requires a seat pass.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
      <p>Press Start will not be officially sanctioning any sleeping areas in the event. You are allowed to "rest" at your desk, but sleeping overnight is not allowed. For those of you staying overnight between the 9-10th, we realize that going back and forth between hotels can be costly, inefficient, and far away, so in response, Jimmy and I have talked about starting a makeshift hostel system to help with housing.</p>

      <p>This will involve placing groups of you within our own apartment/dorm quarters for the night. Nothing fancy, just somewhere to lay down for the night and go back to the event in the morning. Please don't make a mess for us, and please bring your own sleeping materials and toiletries. In total, we can fit probably close to a dozen comfortably, and if we push it, maybe a few more than that. All the officers will try and spare some space for housing.</p>

      <p>As numbers and organization is a concern, we will <em>only</em> be offering this housing option for any entrants for the osu! tournament. Additionally, we will ask for $10 as payment. This is to act as security and responsibility on your part as well as relieving some of the <a href="http:/osuuci.com/donations">upkeep costs</a> of the club and our time spent in organizing this tournament. We feel this is a pretty reasonable offer, and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. To sign up, please make sure to pay us in person at the event or digitally through PayPal:</p>

      <form style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-bottom: -2em;" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">

      <p>And fill out this Google form so we can better organize you and keep records. About a week before the event, we will be sending out emails to those in the program for more exact instructions.</p>
